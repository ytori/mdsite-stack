## Want to add documentation?

By default, place .mdx or .md files under `app/routes/docs`.
For example, `app/routes/docs/hello.md` will be accessible at `/docs/hello`.

## Markdown Syntax Rules

By default, it supports [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/). You can find a brief guide to the syntax in the [Markdown Syntax](/docs/markdown), so please refer to that as well.
Additionally, the following are required in the Frontmatter:

- `title`
- `description`

These Frontmatter fields are used in the `<meta>` tags.

```md
---
title: Hello World
description: This is the documentation about Hello World
---

## Hello

This is my first article.
```

## Want to change routing?

Modify `app/routes.ts`.
Please refer to the [Route Module](https://reactrouter.com/start/framework/route-module) for more details.

## Want to change styles?

By default, the content section of the documentation uses [Tailwind Typography](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-typography).
If you want to apply custom styles to the components converted from MDX, refer to [@mdx-js/react](https://mdxjs.com/packages/react/) to customize the components.

To customize the documentation menu, modify `app/routes/_layout.tsx`.

## Want to change `<meta>` tags?

By default, the content defined in the Frontmatter is output to the `<meta>` tags via the Route Module's [`meta`](https://reactrouter.com/start/framework/route-module#meta).
If you want to customize it, modify the settings in `vite.config.ts`.

## Want to add Remark or Rehype plugins?

Add them to `vite.config.ts`.
